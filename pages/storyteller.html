        <h3 id="clues">Clues</h3>

        <p class="card column">
          The key is knowing your audience. Seasoned gumshoes can sniff out a
          red herring from a mile away, so you gotta get creative with your
          misdirection. Plant false leads that shimmer with possibility, dead
          ends that feel tantalizingly close to the truth. But remember, there's
          a fine line between challenge and confusion. A good mystery is a
          puzzle, not an enigma. So, dole out the clues with a steady hand,
          whispers in the night, a cryptic inscription on a crumpled matchbook.
          Let your players connect the dots, their "Aha!" moments sweeter for
          the struggle. Because in the end, the thrill of the chase is half the
          fun. Just make sure they have enough moonlight to follow the trail,
          but not enough to see the whole picture at once. That's where the real
          magic happens, in the shadowy space between knowing and not knowing,
          where your players become detectives, not just pawns on your twisted
          game board.
          <img src="../assets/audience.jpg" alt="group of citizens" />

        <p class="card column">
          <img src="../assets/clues.jpg" alt="man showing clues" />
          You will have to present clues for the players to follow. It's a tough
          balance to find the right difficulty level for your clues, hidden
          items, and red herrings. Nothing hurts more than your players
          completely unable to solve or progess the game and it's very
          frustating for them to have everything handed to them. Work with your
          players to find the right balance. Every Investigation gives the
          players a Clue Token. After collecting 4 Tokens the players can cash
          them in to get a piece of the bigger picture!
          <br />
          <br />
          Discovering Clues is based on a Percentile 2 D10 or 1 D100 Roll +
          Invenstigation Skill Bonus':
          <br />
          Unmissable Clue - 0 - 25%
          <br />
          Easy Clue - 26 - 50%
          <br />
          Moderate Clue - 51 - 75%
          <br />
          Hard Clue - 76 - 100%
          <br />
          <br />
          Don't forget the Red Herring. Red Herrings are clues specifically
          designed to point the player in the WRONG direction. They can be fun
          and add a lot of depth to your story, but be careful not to overuse
          them. They can be very frustrating for your players.

            <br /><br />

            This ain't no kiddie's playground. The scenarios thrown at you will
            twist your gut, leaving you questioning every shadow and
            second-guessing every move. It'll take more than bravado and a lucky

            City, dreams are what keep you alive. So, partner up, sharpen your
            wits, and get ready to earn your stripes.
            <br /><br />
            Because in this town, only the toughest, smartest, and most
            resourceful gumshoes walk away clean.

            Set Limits!<br /><br />

            Improvise, adapt, and overcome, partner. Crack a safe with a hairpin
            and a pack of gum? Sure, why not. Bribe a crooked cop with a
            well-placed punch and a whispered promise? Go for it. Just remember,
            anything goes in Neon City, as long as it gets the job done. And if
            you manage to pull off a feat of pure, unorthodox brilliance? Well,
            let's just say there might be some unique rewards waiting for you.
            Maybe a rare intel tip, a top-of-the-line weapon, or even a favor
            from someone unexpected. So, ditch the rulebook, hone your street
            smarts, and get ready to show Neon City what you're made of.
            <br /><br />
            After all, in this town, the only limit is your imagination.

            Uncover the Truth!<br /><br />
            Forget spoon-fed answers, gumshoe. Neon City's secrets are buried
            deep, hidden in the shadows and whispers of its inhabitants. You
            won't find the truth neatly wrapped in a bow, waiting to be untied.
            No, you gotta earn it. Pound the pavement, shake down every two-bit
            crook and double-crossing dame you can find. Scour crime scenes for
            clues, their whispers faint as a dying cigarette lighter in the
            rain. Decipher cryptic messages, their meaning as tangled as a
            dame's web of lies.
            <br /><br />

            Because in Neon City, the truth is waiting to be found, but it might
            just cost you more than you bargained for.

            Keep it Exciting!<br /><br />
            Forget static shootouts and cookie-cutter characters, gumshoe. Neon
            City throws curveballs like a drunken sailor on a bender. Every
            encounter is a gamble, a dance with danger that could erupt into a
            heart-stopping shootout or a tense standoff drenched in sweat and
            suspicion. The NPCs you meet ain't cardboard cutouts, either.
            They've got their own agendas, their own secrets, and their own ways
            of playing the game. We ain't promising happily-ever-afters in Neon
            City, but we guarantee you one thing: an experience you won't
            forget.
            <br /><br />
            So, light your cigarette, pull your fedora low, and step into the
            neon abyss. It's gonna be a hell of a night.

        <h3 id="combat">Combat</h3>

        <p class="card column">
          Combat can be the heart-pounding crescendo, the bullet-dodging ballet
          under a hail of gunfire. But just like a jazz solo, too many bars and
          it turns into a cacophony, too few and you lose the rhythm. Finding
          the sweet spot for fisticuffs depends on your story, a delicate dance
          between the players and the perils you throw their way.

          <br />
          <br />
          Turn order starts with whoever initiates combat. It is then clockwise
          around the table. When it gets to the Story Teller he will roll for
          the NPC's.
          <img src="../assets/gangsters.jpg" alt="gangsters at desk" />
        </p>

        <h2>Attack & Defense Rolls</h2>

        <p class="card column">
          <img src="../assets/combat.jpg" alt="gangsters posing with guns" />
          Combat is based on Attack & Defense Rolls.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Attack Roll is based on the dice value of the Attack for player or
          NPC.
          <br />
          <br />
          The damage of the attack is based on the weapon.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Attacker begins by rolling the Attack Dice. The Defender then
          rolls the Defense Dice.
          <br />
          <br />
          If the Attack Roll is higher than the Defense Roll, the attack is
          successful and the damage is applied.
          <br />
          <br />
          If the Defense Roll is higher than the Attack Roll, the attack is
          blocked or dodged. Ties always go to defesnse.
        </p>

        <h2>Critical Hits / Defends</h2>

        <p class="card column">
          CRITICAL HITS/DEFENDS
          <br />
          There are a few exceptions to a succesful hit.
          <br />
          <br />
          If the attacker rolls a 1, it is a critical miss and the attack not
          only fails, but suffes a mishap, such as a misfiring gun or dropping
          their knife. If the defender rolls the highest possible defense, it is
          a critical block and the attack is not only blocked or dodged, but
          they gain an attack of Opportunity.
          <br />
          If the player Attack is higher than the players, but the player rolls
          Critical Dodge then it is still considered a miss!
          <br />
          <br />
          ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY
          <br />
          When a player gains an Attack of Opportunity they automatically get
          the very next attack to the opponent who they critically dodged. After
          the attack/defense rolls it returns to standard turn order.
          <img src="../assets/critical2.png" alt="d20" />

        <h2>Death and Injury</h2>

        <p class="card column">
          <img src="../assets/death.png" alt="death logo" />
          DEATH AND INJURY
          <br />
          <br />

          Here a bad decision can leave you stiffer than a rigged poker deck.
          Here is how Death and Injury work in Gumshoe:
          <br /><br />
          If a player reaches 0 HP they are considered incapacitated.
          <br /><br />
          If they reach -5 HP they are considered mortally wounded and will die
          in 1D4 rounds, unless attended to.
          <br /><br />
          If they reach -10 HP they are considered dead.
          <br /><br />
          They can be healed with Medical Skill Checks or First Aid Kits.
        </p>

        <p class="card column">
          Neon City ain't kind to the careless, chum. Take a wrong turn down a
          dark alley or rub the wrong dame the wrong way, and you might just
          find yourself pushing up daisies (or worse, feeding the fishes in the
          harbor). But hey, that's the beauty of this game, right?
          <br /><br />

          The Storyteller, yours truly, gets to decide if your story ends with a
          whimper or a bang. Maybe a mysterious stranger with a shady past shows
          up to offer a second chance (for a hefty price, of course). Or perhaps
          it's time to introduce a new face to the neon jungle, my goal ain't to
          send you packing – it's to tell a story where every choice has
          consequences, some deadlier than others. So
          <img

        <h2>Loot</h2>

        <p class="card column">
          <img src="../assets/gear.png" alt="antique spy gear" />
          Every win brings rewards. <br /><br />
          Just remember, the bigger the score, the bigger the risk. This town's
          a two-way street.
          <br />
          Loot is earned by defeating foes, finding clues, and completing
          Missions. <br /><br />
          Loot Breaks down as follows:
          <br /><br />
          -Combat<br />
          --- 10 Luck Points <br />
          --- XP (based on enemy difficulty)<br />
          --- 1D4 Clues Token(20 needed for free clue) <br />
          --- 2 D10 dollars
          <br /><br />

          -Clues <br />
          --- 25 Luck Points
          <br />
          --- 100 XP

          <br /><br />
          -Mission
          <br />
          --- 50 Luck Points
          <br />
          --- 250 XP

        <h2>Crafting NPCs</h2>

        <p class="card column">
          Bringing NPCs to life is an art, not a formula. You want them to fit
          seamlessly into the world, yet be intriguing enough to spark player
          interaction.
          <br /><br />
          Even the most meticulously crafted character might flop. Improvisation
          is key!
          <br /><br />Did your charming bartender fall flat? Swap them for a
          gruff one with a hidden agenda. <br /><br />Having a roster of
          ready-made NPCs allows you to adapt on the fly and keep the story
          flowing. <br /><br />
          Don't forget to assign them stats based on the Enemy Example Template.
          Key Items and specialized loot can also be dropped by specific NPCs to
          keep the story cohesive and give your players that extra reward!

        <p class="card column">
          <img src="../assets/barmen.jpg" alt="placeholder" />
          Gameplay is simple. <br />
          After the Character Creation the Story Teller sets the scene. Each
          player then reacts to the scene. You've already seen how combat works,
          but what about non-combat actions?

          <br />
          <br />

          The player can react to the scene in a variety of ways. For instance
          let's say they are in smokey Jazz Hall searching for Gangster. The
          Gangster runs. They can:
          <br />
          <br />
          -Command him to stop
          <br />
          -Persuade the Bouncer to help
          <br />
          -Give Chase

          <br />
          <br />

          If they try to command him to stop they would roll a Intimidate Skill
          Check and any Bonus' in Intimidation
          <br />

        <h2>Creative Actions</h2>

          <img
            id="ghost"
            class="ghost spin"

          />
          <br />
          Creative actions can be handled in a variety of ways. Let's say the
          player wants to shoot down a banner to trap the gangster instead of
          the other examples given.

          <br />
          <br />

          Instead of rolling a complex series of rolls for example:
          <br />

          -Attack Roll for Shot
          <br />
          -Spot Check for Banner
          <br />
          -Perception Check for Gangster and so on

          <br />
          <br />

          You could simplifiy it by having the player roll a Percent Roll.
          <br />
          The difficulty value will be determined by Story Teller on a 1-100
          scale.
          <br />
          1-10 Being very easy and 100 being nearly impossible.

          <br />
          <br />
          So if you decide it's fairly difficult and assign a value of 75. Then
          player would roll their Percent Dice (2D10 or 1D100) and any of their
          Luck Points they wish to Apply.

          <br />
          <br />
          If they succeed the banner falls and the gangster is trapped.

          <br />
          <br />
          If they fail the banner doesn't fall and the gangster gets away.
          <br />
          <br />
          It can be as simple as that!
        </p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p class="card column">
          In the grand carnival of roleplaying, your skills are the flashy
          costumes that make your character stand out from the crowd. Just like
          a seasoned grifter wouldn't be caught dead juggling bowling pins, you
          gotta pick skills that fit your backstory like a well-worn fedora.
          <br /><br />

          Here's the deal: you start with 9 shiny skill points to dish out
          however you see fit. Maybe your character's a wisecracking detective
          with a silver tongue and a knack for picking pockets. Pump those
          points into "Persuasion" and "Sleight of Hand" and watch the suspects
          spill their guts faster than a two-dollar bottle of bootleg hooch.
          <br /><br />
          Skill Checks are performed by using a D20 and adding the appropriate
          Skill Bonus. The Story Teller will set the difficulty of the check.

        <p class="card column">
          Luck Points are a valuable resource. They can be spent to add to a
          percent roll or to reroll a roll. Players accummulate luck roll in the
          combat Section, under Loot<br /><br />
          -Percent Roll - You can spend points and them to your luck roll. Every

          <br /><br />
          XP is earned by completing missions, defeating foes, and finding
          clues. It can be spent to increase skills or HP.
          <br /><br />
          - 500 XP can be spent to increase a skill by 1 point.
          <br /><br />
          - 2000 XP can be spent to increase HP by 5 points.

          Entering the Neon City Police Station was like stepping into a film
          noir come to life. It was a place where hope flickered like a dying
          ember, and the only sure thing was the ever-present stain of
          corruption. The badges weren't shiny symbols of justice; they were
          tarnished tokens of a twisted power dynamic. The cops here weren't
          your knight-in-shining-armor heroes, they were more like walking
          question marks with a price tag. Here's a how a savvy player, might
          use or manipulate the laws of Neon City:

              as a roulette wheel, but his strength is undeniable. How to use
              him: Need someone to shake down a deadbeat gambler or muscle in on
              a rival operation? Big Sal's your guy (for a hefty fee, of
              course). He's even been known to muscle the odd cop when the job
              required. Just be sure you can handle the collateral damage.

              the bigger fish. How to use her: Need a heads-up on an upcoming
              police raid, or intel on a rival gang's operation? Betty can be
              your inside woman, but tread carefully. Cross her and you'll find

              a hat. How to use him: Got a pesky warrant hanging over your head,
              or need someone to "disappear" an incriminating piece of evidence?
              Eddie's your man, but be prepared to pay through the nose (and

          by the Queensbury rules. These spooks, with their flashy triangular
          badges and nervous habits – muttering to their badges like cornered
          rats – were always a step behind me, and somehowe a step ahead. They
          lurked in the shadows like phantoms, their presence a cold wind
          chilling the back of your neck right when you thought you were hot on
          the trail.They sure as hell weren't sharing their secrets, and judging
          by the shifty way they operated, those secrets were darker than a
          moonless night in an alley. One thing for sure you better do your best
          to stay out of their crosshairs, or might be taking a long walk off a
          short pier. But then again, maybe a player could use them to their
          advantage. After all, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?

          fluorescent bulbs, the "Rusty Spikes" surveyed their latest haul – a
          mountain of stolen goods ripped off from a shipment meant for a rival
          casino. The Rusty Spikes were the embodiment of Neon City's
          underbelly, a gang as cruel and ruthless as a broken bottle in a dark
          alley.<br />
          Their territory stretched from the grimy docks to the seediest bars, a
          swathe of Neon City stained with violence and despair. They extorted
          shopkeepers, ran protection rackets, and dealt in anything from
          bootleg booze to stolen pharmaceuticals. Their methods were as
          efficient as they were vicious – a broken kneecap here, a slashed face
          there, a message scrawled in blood on a rival's door.

          turquoise ceramic tiles that shimmered like a mermaid's scales under
          the neon glow, the tower rose in a series of stepped setbacks, each
          adorned with chrome detailing that gleamed like a thousand silver

          Gambling Can be handled many different ways. Here some approaches I
          have taken:
          <br />
          <br />
          -Luck Rolls. Base each game, hand, or spin on a Luck roll.
          <br /><br />
          -Casino Game generators. You can use online resources like Casino game
          generators or online card games to simulate the gambling experience.

          <br /><br />
          -Real Games. You can actually get a deck of cards out, some dice, or
          even a roulette wheel. The only limit is your imagination

          Inside, the air hung thick with the ghosts of past performances – the
          lingering scent of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and the faintest echo
          of a saxophones's wail. Dimly lit by flickering bulbs and mismatched
          lampshades, the walls were adorned with faded photographs of long-gone

              "Pops" Johnson, the owner, a gruff man with a heart as worn as the
              piano keys on stage. He knew everyone who shuffled through – the
              heartbroken saxophonist drowning his sorrows, the aspiring singer
              with a voice as raw as a diamond in the rough, and the occasional
              shady figure with a taste for the blues and a secret to keep
              hidden.

              The club itself was a relic, a two-story building with peeling
              paint and a rickety fire escape clinging to its side like a
              forgotten dream. Dimly lit by flickering bulbs and mismatched
              lampshades, the walls were adorned with faded photographs of
              long-gone jazz legends, their faces etched with the bittersweet
              beauty of a life lived on the edge of a melody.

              Occupying the dimly lit stage of the Rusty Trombone most nights
              was "Smoky" Joe Miller's Ragtime Renegades, a ragtag band of
              veterans who poured their hearts and struggles into every note.The
              band's namesake, Joe was a wiry man with a perpetually ash-stained
              face and a voice as raspy as a rusty hinge. He'd seen it all, and
              made it into song!

        <h2>The Harbor:</h2>

        <p class="card column">
          <img src="../assets/anchor.png" alt="harbor logo" />
          Here, the neon lights that bled into the night sky above met their
          watery demise, staining the oily surface with a fractured reflection
          of the city's decadence. Rusted cranes, like skeletal giants, reached
          for the polluted sky, while grimy freighters belched plumes of black
          smoke, a stark counterpoint to the dazzling skyline. This was a place
          where the salt-laced breeze carried the tang of adventure, the clang
          of industry, where the whispers of a thousand shady deals struck in
          the shadows of towering cargo containers and the unsettling suspicion
          that many an unlucky soul had found a permanent resting place beneath
          the harbor's oily sheen.

              />
              The docks themselves were a haven for those who operated on the
              fringes. Gruff longshoremen, their muscles knotted from years of
              back-breaking labor, unloaded cargo with a practiced indifference,
              their eyes always scanning for opportunities to skim. Shady
              figures, perpetually n shadows, lurked in warehouses brimming with
              exotic goods and questionable merchandise. Here, deals were struck
              with handshakes and terse nods, loyalty as fleeting as the ocean
              currents.

              Under the watchful eyes of rusted cranes and the oily sheen of the
              water, a black market thrived. Stacks of uncut diamonds glittered
              like fallen stars, their brilliance a stark contrast to the dull
              gleam of pilfered weapons. And tucked away in a shadowed corner,
              shrouded in an oily tarp, might lie the ultimate prize – a
              gleaming Skylark automobile, fresh off a freighter and ready to
              disappear into the neon labyrinth of the city.<br />*

              Captain Kim commands the "Full Moon," a rickety freighter that
              reeked more of fish and desperation than luxury. Rumors swirled
              about her past, whispers of a pirate captain on a hidden sea,
              though Kim herself remained tight-lipped, her only confidante a
              talking parrot with a vocabulary as foul as the harbor itself. The
              only constant about Kim was a silver amulet that dangled from her
              neck, its inscription an enigma even to the most skilled
              codebreakers.

          Neon City's harbor pulsed with a life all its own. Here, the rhythmic
          clang of industry mingled with the salty tang of the sea, a stark
          contrast to the neon symphony above. Shady deals went down under the
          watchful gaze of rusted cranes, whispers carried on the ever-present
          breeze. Players with a knack for thievery could mingle with
          dockworkers, their pockets potentially lined with pilfered goods
          Captain Kim might "accidentally" overlook if the price was right. Need
          a place to lay low after a messy heist? The rickety taverns lining the
          docks offered a temporary haven, a place to disappear into the
          anonymity of the harbor's underbelly for a price, of course. But
          remember, in Neon City's harbor, every shadow hides a secret, and
          every corner whispers a story. Just be careful which ones you choose
          to listen to.

          Unlike its flashy cousins downtown, the Starlite wasn't a beacon of
          dazzling lights. Its faded neon sign, a lonely astronaut holding a
          flickering star, cast an ethereal glow on the peeling turquoise paint.
          Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and
          something that vaguely resembled disinfectant.
          <br />
          <br />

          Run by the smiling man Handsom Bob and his constant companion, his
          daughter, Adriana. Barely a pre-teen, she possessed a wisdom beyond
          her years. Her dark eyes held a spark of defiance, a reminder of the
          struggles they'd faced together. She kept the Starlite running with a
          quiet efficiency.
          <br />
          <br />

          The Starlite Motel wasn't glamorous, but it offered a flicker of
          solace, shimmering faintly like the lonely star on the motel's faded
          sign.

          So, your players have cracked the case, tangled with the Rusty Spikes,
          and maybe even gotten their hands on a souped-up Skylark. Here's where
          you crank the neon to eleven and unleash the real mind-blower.
          <br /><br />
          Maybe that pulsating billboard wasn't advertising a new brand of
          cigarettes, but a message from a visitor from outerspace. The
          possibilities are as limitless as the neon sky.

          Leave your players blinking, bewildered, and maybe even a little

          Rain slicked the chrome of my trench coat, the neon glow of Neon City
          bleeding into the puddles like spilled dreams. This dame, long gone
          and presumed dead, had resurfaced on a flimsy postcard. Her message, a
          cryptic plea for help, tugged at the ghost of what we once had. Neon
          City. A rocky hideaway where pleasure and peril intertwined like
          vipers in a heat haze. I wasn't built for sunshine and sand, my skills
          honed in the shadows of steel canyons. But a dame in distress? That's
          a case I couldn't walk away from.

          The smog hung heavy over Tinseltown, a sickly yellow halo above the
          hazy dreamscape. Here, ambition dripped like sweat under the merciless
          California sun, where fortunes were made and shattered faster than a
          celluloid kiss. Dames with million-dollar smiles hawked their wares,
          and chisel-jawed fellas with steely gazes dreamt of the silver screen.
          But beneath the glitz, a darkness festered. Whispers slithered through
          back alleys, tales of things unnatural, of creatures from beyond the
          frame. Hollywoodland, they called it. More like Hollyweirdland, a
          place where the scripts got stranger than anything dreamed up by a
          drunken screenwriter. You, chum, are the only shamus with the guts
          (and the bottle) to wade through this celluloid nightmare.

          The Amazon humidity hung heavy in Rio, a suffocating cloak over the
          vibrant chaos. Christ the Redeemer, its skeletal form reaching towards
          the hazy sky, offered no solace. Here, in 1936 Rio, the samba pulsed
          with a darker rhythm. I, a weary gumshoe used to the grit of New York
          City, had arrived for some sun-drenched R&R. But past sins are like
          stray bullets, they have a way of finding you, even in paradise. A
          face from a forgotten case materialized across the casino floor –
          Frankie "The Fox" Moretti, a hood I put away back in '32. He shouldn't
          be here, breathing, radiating barely contained rage. Looks like my Rio
          vacation just took a sharp turn into a labyrinth of showgirls with
          deadly secrets, a murder threatening to ignite a war, and Frankie "The
          Fox" Moretti thirsting for revenge as cold as a Rio night. This dame
          in distress wouldn't be wearing a swimsuit, but a shroud.

          Moscow, a frozen tomb bathed in perpetual twilight. Not exactly your
          typical tourist trap. You, a gumshoe with a nose for trouble and a
          taste for cheap vodka, were partnered with Nika Arovka, a Soviet
          ambassador with a smile too sharp and eyes like glacial ice. Whispers
          of strange men in uniforms and ancient alien devices with world-ending
          power sent you both hurtling through this frozen hell. Tracked once
          again by the Mysterious Penrose Division: you, a down-on-your-luck
          detective, and a femme fatale with buried secrets, were all that stood
          between oblivion and a world cracked open like a rotten egg.

          The last case went sideways faster than a greased getaway car. Now,
          you find yourself yanked from the familiar grime and grit and

          what they call themselves. Seems this rabbit hole runs deeper than a
          bootleg speakeasy. Multiverse travel, alternate realities, alien
          threats, the whole kit and kaboodle. All under the steely gaze of your
          new boss, April Sunday. A dame with a name that wouldn't be out of
          place in a bygone era, stuck in a world that makes yesterday's case
          look like a walk in the park. One thing's for sure, shamus: the gloves
          are off. Crack the case with the help of your new partner Nika Arovak,
          stop whatever's bleeding through the seams of reality, and maybe, just
          maybe, impress Ms. Sunday enough to learn the mystery that started
          this whole adventure!
