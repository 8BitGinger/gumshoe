          Gumshoe is a detective game set in a neon-noir city. The game is
          designed to be played by friends cooperatively as a TTRPG.

          In order to fully immerse the players in the world of Gumshoe, we first need to create a character for them to play. This character will be the player's avatar in the game, and will be used to interact with the world and other characters. The character will have a name, a backstory, and a class that provides a set of skills and items that will help them solve the case.

        <p class="column">
          The backstory will help the player understand the character's motivations and goals. It will also help the player understand the character's place in the world, and how they fit into the story of the game.  Work with your Story Teller to come up with a backstory that works with within his Adventure and the world of Gumshoe.
