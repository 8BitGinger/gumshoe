              interrogation lamps, but beneath that glitz and glamour, there's a
              darkness thicker than a week-old cigar. <br /><br />
              Yeah, the night sky's a canvas for a million neon signs, and the
              air thrums with music that'd make a saint tap a foot. But listen
              closer, and you hear the clink of bootleg liquor glasses in
              speakeasies tucked away in forgotten alleys.
              <br /><br />
              Burlesque halls and opium dens offer their own kind of escape, the
              fast kind that leaves you hollowed out and wanting more. And if
              you manage to steer clear of those temptations, you still gotta
              face The Block.
              <br /><br />
              Towers of sin, practically touching, each room a portal to a
              different kind of vice. Gambling, girls, shows you wouldn't
              believe. They call it a marvel of modern society, but it's a
              monument to mankind's darkest desires.
              <br /><br />
              Neon City's underbelly, it ain't just about this town, see? It's a
              reflection of somethin' deeper, somethin' that lurks in all of us,
              waiting for the right moment to slither out."

          You lost your only love years ago, or so you thought. The postcard is
          worn, a relic of a love you thought lost forever. Your lover's
          familiar scrawl beckons for your help in Neon City, a mirage of glitz
          and vice in the shimmering desert.

          But whispers tell of their murder â€“ a death they seem to have cheated
          once before, somehow, but couldn't again. Now, amidst the crooked cops
          and ruthless gangsters of this 1930s underworld, you arrive to find
          yourself entangled in a mystery far stranger than you imagined. Secret
          agents from the clandestine Penrose Division, prohibition-flouting
          speakeasies, and the seductive thrum of jazz clubs form the backdrop
          of your search for the truth about who killed your lover, why she
          wasn't dead before, and the identity of the mysterious agents
          following you.

          But even the city's dazzling lights can't mask the dark secrets it
          holds. Your only hope seems to be Frank Hodgkins, a haggard and
          perpetually-drunk detective with a gruff exterior and a surprisingly
          noble sense of morality. Though his cynicism runs deep, the glint of
          determination in his bloodshot eyes hints at a past that fuels his
          refusal to turn a blind eye to the city's corruption.

          Another ally comes in the form of Ruby Dubois, a young, aspiring jazz
          singer with a voice as smooth as velvet and eyes that hold the wisdom
          of the streets. Her dreams of the spotlight intertwine with yours as
          she too longs to unravel the mysteries that threaten to consume Neon
          City. Her reasons may remain unclear, but her loyalty is unwavering.

          You will be purused by Agents of the Mysterious Penrose Division of
          the FBI. Their goals and interests unknown, they seem to be stalking
          your every move. They are a force to be reckoned with and will stop at
          nothing to keep you from uncovering the truth.

        <p class="column">
          Together, you'll navigate the neon-drenched labyrinth, armed with your
          wits, a flicker of impossible hope, and the unlikely alliance of a
          washed-up detective and a fiery songbird, all to unravel a conspiracy
          that twists the very fabric of reality.

          Rain slicked the neon-drenched streets of Neon City, reflecting the
          city's seedy underbelly in a distorted kaleidoscope. In this concrete
          jungle, the only warmth came from the cheap whiskey swirling in your
          glass.
          <br /><br />
          Gumshoe Neon City, the dame whispered, tracing a fingertip across the
          condensation on the glass. "A role-playing game for you and your pals,
          she purred." One of you, the grizzled storyteller, sets the scene,
          weaving a web of lies and secrets as thick as the fog rolling off the
          docks. The rest of you, hardened gumshoes with more scars than morals,
          step into the neon-lit shadows, chasing phantoms and buried truths.
        </p>
        <p class="column avatar">
          Every choice you make ripples through the story, twisting the
          narrative like a bullet ricocheting off a mirrored wall. Encounters
          with shifty molls and two-bit thugs test your mettle. Cryptic clues,
          buried deep in the city's underbelly, whisper of a conspiracy bigger
          than your wildest dreams.
          <br /><br />The dame's death, once a closed case, now bleeds
          suspicion. Was she really dead? Or was she just another pawn in a game
          you didn't even know you were playing? Neon City holds more secrets
          than a double-breasted trench coat has pockets, and you'll need all
          your wits, brawn, and maybe a good dame on your side to survive its
          dark embrace. <br /><br />
          So grab your fedora, slug down the rest of that whiskey, and step into
          the neon abyss. The clock's ticking, gumshoe. And in Neon City, time
          is measured in bullets.

          Neon City ain't a place for the nameless, partner. Before you even set
          foot in this concrete jungle, you gotta craft your own legend. Name,
          class, and the dirty details of your past. You could be a hardened
          Hardboiled Detective, a relic from a bygone era with a trench coat as
          worn as your soul. Maybe you're a slick Gangster, your silver tongue
          sharper than any blade. Or perhaps you're a struggling talented
          Musician, navigating the city's underbelly with the soul of a poet.

          <br /><br />
          So, craft your legend wisely, because in Neon City, your reputation
          precedes you.The classes are as follows:

            <br /><br />
            Forget participation trophies, gumshoe. In Neon City, victories are
            earned, not given. Sure, you can stumble through a case with your
            trigger finger twitchy and your brain on vacation, but where's the
            satisfaction in that? A narrow win, sweat beading on your brow, the
            taste of copper in your mouth - that's where the real thrill lies.
            <br /><br />
            This ain't no kiddie's playground. The scenarios thrown at you will
            twist your gut, leaving you questioning every shadow and
            second-guessing every move. It'll take more than bravado and a lucky
            break to crack these cases. You'll need to think like a chess
            grandmaster, ten steps ahead, your crew working in sync like a
            well-oiled gat. Remember, teamwork makes the dream work, and in Neon
            City, dreams are what keep you alive. So, partner up, sharpen your
            wits, and get ready to earn your stripes.
            <br /><br />
            Because in this town, only the toughest, smartest, and most
            resourceful gumshoes walk away clean.

            Set Limits!<br /><br />
            Neon City ain't built for the rule-abiding, gumshoe. Time's a fickle
            dame, always running out faster than you can say "case closed."
            Resources? Scarcer than a decent dame in a dive bar. And the rules?
            Well, let's just say they're more like guidelines, meant to be bent,
            not followed blindly. That's where your real test comes in. When the
            clock's ticking, your pockets are lighter than a ghost on a fast
            break, and the only rule seems to be "every man for himself," that's
            when you gotta think outside the neon-drenched box.
            <br /><br />
            Improvise, adapt, and overcome, partner. Crack a safe with a hairpin
            and a pack of gum? Sure, why not. Bribe a crooked cop with a
            well-placed punch and a whispered promise? Go for it. Just remember,
            anything goes in Neon City, as long as it gets the job done. And if
            you manage to pull off a feat of pure, unorthodox brilliance? Well,
            let's just say there might be some unique rewards waiting for you.
            Maybe a rare intel tip, a top-of-the-line weapon, or even a favor
            from someone unexpected. So, ditch the rulebook, hone your street
            smarts, and get ready to show Neon City what you're made of.
            <br /><br />
            After all, in this town, the only limit is your imagination.

          <p>
            Uncover the Truth!<br /><br />
            Forget spoon-fed answers, gumshoe. Neon City's secrets are buried
            deep, hidden in the shadows and whispers of its inhabitants. You
            won't find the truth neatly wrapped in a bow, waiting to be untied.
            No, you gotta earn it. Pound the pavement, shake down every two-bit
            crook and double-crossing dame you can find. Scour crime scenes for
            clues, their whispers faint as a dying cigarette lighter in the
            rain. Decipher cryptic messages, their meaning as tangled as a
            dame's web of lies.
            <br /><br />
            Every piece you gather, every puzzle you crack, is a brick in the
            wall of truth you're building. But remember, gumshoe, the truth can
            be a double-edged sword. What you uncover might not be what you were
            looking for, and it could change the game entirely. But that's the
            beauty of the beast, ain't it? The thrill of the chase, the
            uncertainty of what lies ahead â€“ that's what keeps the blood pumping
            and the smoke curling off your cigarette. So, put on your best
            detective hat, partner, and get ready to dig deep.
            <br /><br />
            Because in Neon City, the truth is waiting to be found, but it might
            just cost you more than you bargained for.

            Keep it Exciting!<br /><br />
            Forget static shootouts and cookie-cutter characters, gumshoe. Neon
            City throws curveballs like a drunken sailor on a bender. Every
            encounter is a gamble, a dance with danger that could erupt into a
            heart-stopping shootout or a tense standoff drenched in sweat and
            suspicion. The NPCs you meet ain't cardboard cutouts, either.
            They've got their own agendas, their own secrets, and their own ways
            of playing the game.
            <br /><br />
            Some might be allies, offering cryptic clues for a price. Others
            might be double-crossing weasels, ready to sell you out for a
            handful of crumpled bills. And the story itself? Buckle up, partner,
            because it's a wild ride. Twists and turns sharper than a dame's
            high heels, betrayals that'll leave you reeling, and revelations
            that'll make your head spin. We ain't promising happily-ever-afters
            in Neon City, but we guarantee you one thing: an experience you
            won't forget.
            <br /><br />
            So, light your cigarette, pull your fedora low, and step into the
            neon abyss. It's gonna be a hell of a night.
