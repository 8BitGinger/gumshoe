        <p class="card column">
          The key is knowing your audience. Seasoned gumshoes can sniff out a
          red herring from a mile away, so you gotta get creative with your
          misdirection. Plant false leads that shimmer with possibility, dead
          ends that feel tantalizingly close to the truth. But remember, there's
          a fine line between challenge and confusion. A good mystery is a
          puzzle, not an enigma. So, dole out the clues with a steady hand,
          whispers in the night, a cryptic inscription on a crumpled matchbook.
          Let your players connect the dots, their "Aha!" moments sweeter for
          the struggle. Because in the end, the thrill of the chase is half the
          fun. Just make sure they have enough moonlight to follow the trail,
          but not enough to see the whole picture at once. That's where the real
          magic happens, in the shadowy space between knowing and not knowing,
          where your players become detectives, not just pawns on your twisted
          game board.

        <p class="card column">
          <img src="../assets/clues.jpg" alt="man showing clues" />
          You will have to present clues for the players to follow. It's a tough
          balance to find the right difficulty level for your clues, hidden
          items, and red herrings. Nothing hurts more than your players
          completely unable to solve or progess the game and it's very
          frustating for them to have everything handed to them. Work with your
          players to find the right balance.
          <br />
          <br />
          Discovering Clues is based on a Percentile 2 D10 or 1 D100 Roll +
          Invenstigation Skill Bonus':
          <br />
          Unmissable Clue - 0 - 25%
          <br />
          Easy Clue - 26 - 50%
          <br />
          Moderate Clue - 51 - 75%
          <br />
          Hard Clue - 76 - 100%
          <br />
          <br />
          Don't forget the Red Herring. Red Herrings are clues specifically
          designed to point the player in the WRONG direction. They can be fun
          and add a lot of depth to your story, but be careful not to overuse
          them. They can be very frustrating for your players.

            This ain't no kiddie's playground. The scenarios thrown at you will
            twist your gut, leaving you questioning every shadow and
            second-guessing every move. It'll take more than bravado and a lucky
            break to crack these cases. You'll need to think like a chess
            grandmaster, ten steps ahead, your crew working in sync like a
            well-oiled gat. Remember, teamwork makes the dream work, and in Neon
            City, dreams are what keep you alive. So, partner up, sharpen your
            wits, and get ready to earn your stripes.

            Set Limits!<br /><br />

            Improvise, adapt, and overcome, partner. Crack a safe with a hairpin
            and a pack of gum? Sure, why not. Bribe a crooked cop with a
            well-placed punch and a whispered promise? Go for it. Just remember,
            anything goes in Neon City, as long as it gets the job done. And if
            you manage to pull off a feat of pure, unorthodox brilliance? Well,
            let's just say there might be some unique rewards waiting for you.
            Maybe a rare intel tip, a top-of-the-line weapon, or even a favor
            from someone unexpected. So, ditch the rulebook, hone your street
            smarts, and get ready to show Neon City what you're made of.
            <br /><br />
            After all, in this town, the only limit is your imagination.

            Forget spoon-fed answers, gumshoe. Neon City's secrets are buried
            deep, hidden in the shadows and whispers of its inhabitants. You
            won't find the truth neatly wrapped in a bow, waiting to be untied.
            No, you gotta earn it. Pound the pavement, shake down every two-bit
            crook and double-crossing dame you can find. Scour crime scenes for
            clues, their whispers faint as a dying cigarette lighter in the
            rain. Decipher cryptic messages, their meaning as tangled as a
            dame's web of lies.
            <br /><br />

            Because in Neon City, the truth is waiting to be found, but it might
            just cost you more than you bargained for.

            Forget static shootouts and cookie-cutter characters, gumshoe. Neon
            City throws curveballs like a drunken sailor on a bender. Every
            encounter is a gamble, a dance with danger that could erupt into a
            heart-stopping shootout or a tense standoff drenched in sweat and
            suspicion. The NPCs you meet ain't cardboard cutouts, either.
            They've got their own agendas, their own secrets, and their own ways
            of playing the game. We ain't promising happily-ever-afters in Neon
            City, but we guarantee you one thing: an experience you won't
            forget.
            <br /><br />
            So, light your cigarette, pull your fedora low, and step into the

        <h3 id="combat">Combat</h3>

        <p class="card column">
          Combat can be the heart-pounding crescendo, the bullet-dodging ballet
          under a hail of gunfire. But just like a jazz solo, too many bars and
          it turns into a cacophony, too few and you lose the rhythm. Finding
          the sweet spot for fisticuffs depends on your story, a delicate dance
          between the players and the perils you throw their way.

          <br />
          <br />
          Turn order starts with whoever initiates combat. It is then clockwise
          around the table. When it gets to the Story Teller he will roll for
          the NPC's.
          <img src="../assets/gangsters.jpg" alt="gangsters at desk" />
        </p>

        <p class="card column">
          <img src="../assets/combat.jpg" alt="gangsters posing with guns" />
          Combat is based on Attack & Defense Rolls.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Attack Roll is based on the dice value of the Attack for player or
          NPC.
          <br />
          <br />
          The damage of the attack is based on the weapon.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Attacker begins by rolling the Attack Dice. The Defender then
          rolls the Defense Dice.
          <br />
          <br />
          If the Attack Roll is higher than the Defense Roll, the attack is
          successful and the damage is applied.
          <br />
          <br />
          If the Defense Roll is higher than the Attack Roll, the attack is
          blocked or dodged. Ties always go to defesnse.
        </p>

        <p class="card column">
          CRITICAL HITS/DEFENDS
          <br />
          There are a few exceptions to a succesful hit.
          <br />
          <br />
          If the attacker rolls a 1, it is a critical miss and the attack not
          only fails, but suffes a mishap, such as a misfiring gun or dropping
          their knife. If the defender rolls the highest possible defense, it is
          a critical block and the attack is not only blocked or dodged, but
          they gain an attack of Opportunity.
          <br />
          If the player Attack is higher than the players, but the player rolls
          Critical Dodge then it is still considered a miss!
          <br />
          <br />
          ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY
          <br />
          When a player gains an Attack of Opportunity they automatically get
          the very next attack to the opponent who they critically dodged. After
          the attack/defense rolls it returns to standard turn order.

          Gameplay <br />
          Skills, Actions, and Points:
        </h3>

        <p class="card column">
          <img src="../assets/barmen.jpg" alt="placeholder" />
          Gameplay is simple. After the Character Creation the Story Teller sets
          the scene. Each player then reacts to the scene. You've already seen
          how combat works, but what about non-combat actions?

          <br />
          <br />

          The player can react to the scene in a variety of ways. For instance
          let's say they are in smokey Jazz Hall searching for Gangster. The
          Gangster runs. They can:
          <br />
          <br />
          -Command him to stop
          <br />
          -Persuade the Bouncer to help
          <br />
          -Give Chase

          <br />
          <br />

          If they try to command him to stop they would roll a Intimidate Skill
          Check and any Bonus' in Intimidation
          <br />
          <br />
          If they try to persuade the Bouncer they would roll a Persuasion Skill
          check and add any Bonus' in Persuasion.
          <br />
          <br />
          If they give chase they would roll an Atheltics Skill check and add
          any Bonus' in Athetlics.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <h2>Creative Actions</h2>
        <p>
          Creative actions can be handled in a variety of ways. Let's say the
          player wants to shoot down a banner to trap the gangster instead of
          the other examples given.

          <br />
          <br />

          Instead of rolling a complex series of rolls for example:
          <br />

          -Attack Roll for Shot
          <br />
          -Spot Check for Banner
          <br />
          -Perception Check for Gangster and so on

          <br />
          <br />

          You could simplifiy it by having the player roll a Percent Roll.
          <br />
          The difficulty value will be determined by Story Teller on a 1-100
          scale.
          <br />
          1-10 Being very easy and 100 being nearly impossible.

          <br />
          <br />
          So if you decide it's fairly difficult and assign a value of 75. Then
          player would roll their Percent Dice (2D10 or 1D100) and any of their
          Luck Points they wish to Apply.

          <br />
          <br />
          If they succeed the banner falls and the gangster is trapped.

          <br />
          <br />
          If they fail the banner doesn't fall and the gangster gets away.
          <br />
          <br />
          It can be as simple as that!

        <p class="card column">
          <img src="../assets/lawman.png" alt="police officer" />

          Entering the Neon City Police Station was like stepping into a film
          noir come to life. It was a place where hope flickered like a dying
          ember, and the only sure thing was the ever-present stain of
          corruption. The badges weren't shiny symbols of justice; they were
          tarnished tokens of a twisted power dynamic. The cops here weren't
          your knight-in-shining-armor heroes, they were more like walking
          question marks with a price tag. Here's a how a savvy player, might
          use or manipulate the laws of Neon City:

              A hulking ex-boxer with fists the size of hams and a brain the
              size of a pea. Sal's loyalty is as fickle as a roulette wheel, but
              his strength is undeniable. How to use him: Need someone to shake
              down a deadbeat gambler or muscle in on a rival operation? Big
              Sal's your guy (for a hefty fee, of course). Just be sure you can
              handle the collateral damage.

              />
              Sharp as a tack and twice as jaded, Betty's disillusioned with the
              department's corruption. She leaks information for the right
              price, but only if it helps bring down the bigger fish. How to use
              her: Need a heads-up on an upcoming police raid, or intel on a
              rival gang's operation? Betty can be your inside woman, but tread
              carefully. Cross her and you'll find yourself facing the full
              force of the corrupt system she despises.

              Eddie's a walking rolodex of dirty cops, corrupt judges, and even
              seedier informants. He can make a traffic violation disappear
              faster than a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat. How to use
              him: Got a pesky warrant hanging over your head, or need someone
              to "disappear" an incriminating piece of evidence? Eddie's your
              man, but be prepared to pay through the nose (and maybe even an
              alibi or two).

          The Bureau boys with their fancy new Penrose Division weren't playing
          by the Queensbury rules. These spooks, with their flashy triangular
          badges and nervous habits – muttering to their badges like cornered
          rats – were always a step behind me, and somehowe a step ahead. They
          lurked in the shadows like phantoms, their presence a cold wind
          chilling the back of your neck right when you thought you were hot on
          the trail.They sure as hell weren't sharing their secrets, and judging
          by the shifty way they operated, those secrets were darker than a
          moonless night in an alley. One thing for sure you better do your best
          to stay out of their crosshairs, or might be taking a long walk off a
          short pier. But then again, maybe a player could use them to their
          advantage. After all, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?

          Rain slicked the chrome of my trench coat, the neon glow of Neon City
          bleeding into the puddles like spilled dreams. This dame, long gone
          and presumed dead, had resurfaced on a flimsy postcard. Her message, a
          cryptic plea for help, tugged at the ghost of what we once had. Neon
          City. A rocky hideaway where pleasure and peril intertwined like
          vipers in a heat haze. I wasn't built for sunshine and sand, my skills
          honed in the shadows of steel canyons. But a dame in distress? That's
          a case I couldn't walk away from.

          The smog hung heavy over Tinseltown, a sickly yellow halo above the
          hazy dreamscape. Here, ambition dripped like sweat under the merciless
          California sun, where fortunes were made and shattered faster than a
          celluloid kiss. Dames with million-dollar smiles hawked their wares,
          and chisel-jawed fellas with steely gazes dreamt of the silver screen.
          But beneath the glitz, a darkness festered. Whispers slithered through
          back alleys, tales of things unnatural, of creatures from beyond the
          frame. Hollywoodland, they called it. More like Hollyweirdland, a
          place where the scripts got stranger than anything dreamed up by a
          drunken screenwriter. You, chum, are the only shamus with the guts
          (and the bottle) to wade through this celluloid nightmare.

          The Amazon humidity hung heavy in Rio, a suffocating cloak over the
          vibrant chaos. Christ the Redeemer, its skeletal form reaching towards
          the hazy sky, offered no solace. Here, in 1936 Rio, the samba pulsed
          with a darker rhythm. I, a weary gumshoe used to the grit of New York
          City, had arrived for some sun-drenched R&R. But past sins are like
          stray bullets, they have a way of finding you, even in paradise. A
          face from a forgotten case materialized across the casino floor –
          Frankie "The Fox" Moretti, a hood I put away back in '32. He shouldn't
          be here, breathing, radiating barely contained rage. Looks like my Rio
          vacation just took a sharp turn into a labyrinth of showgirls with
          deadly secrets, a murder threatening to ignite a war, and Frankie "The
          Fox" Moretti thirsting for revenge as cold as a Rio night. This dame
          in distress wouldn't be wearing a swimsuit, but a shroud.

          Moscow, a frozen tomb bathed in perpetual twilight. Not exactly your
          typical tourist trap. You, a gumshoe with a nose for trouble and a
          taste for cheap vodka, were partnered with Nika Arovka, a Soviet
          ambassador with a smile too sharp and eyes like glacial ice. Whispers
          of strange men in uniforms and ancient alien devices with world-ending
          power sent you both hurtling through this frozen hell. Tracked once
          again by the Mysterious Penrose Division: you, a down-on-your-luck
          detective, and a femme fatale with buried secrets, were all that stood
          between oblivion and a world cracked open like a rotten egg.

          The last case went sideways faster than a greased getaway car. Now,
          you find yourself yanked from the familiar grime and grit and
          deposited in... well, who even knows? The Penrose Division, that's
          what they call themselves. Seems this rabbit hole runs deeper than a
          bootleg speakeasy. Multiverse travel, alternate realities, alien
          threats, the whole kit and kaboodle. All under the steely gaze of your
          new boss, April Sunday. A dame with a name that wouldn't be out of
          place in a bygone era, stuck in a world that makes yesterday's case
          look like a walk in the park. One thing's for sure, shamus: the gloves
          are off. Crack the case with the help of your new partner Nika Arovak,
          stop whatever's bleeding through the seams of reality, and maybe, just
          maybe, impress Ms. Sunday enough to learn the mystery that started
          this whole adventure!
