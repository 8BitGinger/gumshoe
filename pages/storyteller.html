          You will have to present clues for the players to follow.  It's a tough balance to find the right difficulty level for your clues, hidden items, and red herrings.  Nothing hurts more than your players completely unable to solve or progess the game and it's very frustating for them to have everything handed to them.  Work with your players to find the right balance.
          <br>
          <br>
          Discovering Clues is based on a Percentile 2 D10 or 1 D100 Roll:
          <br>
          Unmissable Clue - 0 - 25%
          <br>
          Easy Clue - 26 - 50%
          <br>
          Moderate Clue - 51 - 75%
          <br>
          Hard Clue - 76 - 100%
          <br>
          <br>
          Don't forget the Red Herring.  Red Herrings are clues specifically designed to point the player in the WRONG direction.  They can be fun and add a lot of depth to your story, but be careful not to overuse them.  They can be very frustrating for your players.

          Rain slicked the chrome of my trench coat, the neon glow of Neon City bleeding into the puddles like spilled dreams. This dame, long gone and presumed dead, had resurfaced on a flimsy postcard. Her message, a cryptic plea for help, tugged at the ghost of what we once had.

Neon City. A rocky hideaway where pleasure and peril intertwined like vipers in a heat haze. I wasn't built for sunshine and sand, my skills honed in the shadows of steel canyons. But a dame in distress? That's a case I couldn't walk away from.

        <h3>Future Adventures</h3>
        <p class="card column">
          <img src="../assets/readme/hollywoodland-sepia.jpg" alt="hollywoodland logo" />
The smog hung heavy over Tinseltown, a sickly yellow halo above the hazy dreamscape. Here, ambition dripped like sweat under the merciless California sun, where fortunes were made and shattered faster than a celluloid kiss. Dames with million-dollar smiles hawked their wares, and chisel-jawed fellas with steely gazes dreamt of the silver screen. But beneath the glitz, a darkness festered. Whispers slithered through back alleys, tales of things unnatural, of creatures from beyond the frame. Hollywoodland, they called it. More like Hollyweirdland, a place where the scripts got stranger than anything dreamed up by a drunken screenwriter. You, chum, are the only shamus with the guts (and the bottle) to wade through this celluloid nightmare.        </p>

        <p class="card column">
          The Amazon humidity hung heavy in Rio, a suffocating cloak over the vibrant chaos. Christ the Redeemer, its skeletal form reaching towards the hazy sky, offered no solace. Here, in 1936 Rio, the samba pulsed with a darker rhythm. I, a weary gumshoe used to the grit of New York City, had arrived for some sun-drenched R&R. But past sins are like stray bullets, they have a way of finding you, even in paradise. A face from a forgotten case materialized across the casino floor – Frankie "The Fox" Moretti, a hood I put away back in '32. He shouldn't be here, breathing, radiating barely contained rage. Looks like my Rio vacation just took a sharp turn into a labyrinth of showgirls with deadly secrets, a murder threatening to ignite a war, and Frankie "The Fox" Moretti thirsting for revenge as cold as a Rio night. This dame in distress wouldn't be wearing a swimsuit, but a shroud.

                Moscow, a frozen tomb bathed in perpetual twilight. Not exactly your typical tourist trap. You, a gumshoe with a nose for trouble and a taste for cheap vodka, were partnered with Nika Arovka, a Soviet ambassador with a smile too sharp and eyes like glacial ice. Whispers of strange men in uniforms and ancient alien devices with world-ending power sent you both hurtling through this frozen hell. Tracked once again by the Mysterious Penrose Division: you, a down-on-your-luck detective, and a femme fatale with buried secrets, were all that stood between oblivion and a world cracked open like a rotten egg.

                  The last case went sideways faster than a greased getaway car. Now, you find yourself yanked from the familiar grime and grit and deposited in... well, who even knows? The Penrose Division, that's what they call themselves. Seems this rabbit hole runs deeper than a bootleg speakeasy. Multiverse travel, alternate realities, alien threats, the whole kit and kaboodle. All under the steely gaze of your new boss, April Sunday. A dame with a name that wouldn't be out of place in a bygone era, stuck in a world that makes yesterday's case look like a walk in the park. One thing's for sure, shamus: the gloves are off. Crack the case with the help of your new partner Nika Arovak, stop whatever's bleeding through the seams of reality, and maybe, just maybe, impress Ms. Sunday enough to learn the mystery that started this whole adventure!
